A REPORT ON THE TEKSERIES + LEARNFACTORY EVENT AT CENTERPOINT OWERRI

The tekSeries + LearnFactory event at Center Point Owerri which held on 26th of March at Center Point Owerri was a huge success.

On the day of the event, Chidera Ugwuanyi left from Aba while Eze Bernadine May and George Favour came from Umuahia, this is because they were in school alreAdy. Prior to the day of the event, Mr Chibueze had given Chidera other necessary informations such as the name of the organizer and his contact. That day too, Chidera made contact with Mr Chijioke Metu the organizer who was very excited that we were coming. He used the opportunity to provide proper direction to the venue, 57 Okigwe Road, Owerri.

The official time of the event was slated for 9:30pm, however, due to traffic and other unfathomed travel conditions, Chidera arrived at 10:00am, Bernadine and Favour will arrive later. When Chidera got to the venue, Center Point was not difficult to recognize as it was towering along the Okigwe road. Chidera enterd the building and was met by Mr Chijioke who was full of enthusiasm. A brief chat with him lasted for about fifteen minutes.

During the chat, he told Chidera that he was a United States based lawyer but he is passionate about bringing technology to the African youths. He said "We've been doing this for three years, and in all those times, we've been looking for Eastern hubs that share our ideas. That's how I came across LearnFactory through the internet. Immediately I sent a mail to Chibueze. After I didn't get a reply, I had to place a call to him. Today is part of the fruit of that conversation." 

After the chat he gave Chidera few momemts to organize himself to meet the students. The students had this same enthusiasm in them.  At the time, they were about twenty five plus students already seated. More will come in later.

Chidera was introduced by Mr Chijioke to the students. He began by appreciating the efforts of tekSeries, introducing himself and talking about what will be done today which is part of to build the twitter landing page.
 The lectures will be handled in three phases: Chidera will introduce HTML, Bernadine will teach CSS while Favour will handle Javascript. At this point, The duo of Favour and Bern have arrived. 

However, because of the lack of a good editor, Chidera had to install vscode for the students in other to hasten the teaching process. He dove into HTML, introduced it and went straight to practical coding sessions. The students were extrememly excited of what they were experiencing. They were building along the twitter landing Page. By 13:30hrs, Chidera rounded up HTML for the students to go on a thirty minutes break of snacks and resting. The students refused, they said thirty minutes was too much. Finally, the class converged again and Bernadine started off with CSS.

After Bernadine was intoduced to the students, she aligned with the students and began to discuss CSS with them. She continued to use it to style the twitter landing page. At this point, the students couldn't hide the joy of what they were seeing. Bernadine did an extremely good job with CSS. 

The teaching session ended with George Favour taking the Javascript session. George used javascript to perform authentication on the twitter login form. He carried the students along and they followed diligently.A greater number of the students had their codes working well. All through the sessions, Mr Chijioke was around cheering up the team and making them feel comfortable.

After the teaching session, Chidera came up again, appreciated the efforts of TekSeries and LearnFctory and used the opportunity to talk about the LearnFactory Internship. Although this sesssion caused some little misunderstanding as the owners of Center Point was angry because there is Aptech there and Aptech is also a tech School.

As soon Chidera concluded, Mr Chijioke Metuh came, admonished the students, and gave the farewell speech. We all took pictures and socialized. Mr Chijioke very excited because according to him, the trio did beyond his expectation. He however, gave a tip of twenty thousand naira (â‚¦20,000) to the trio and said "Please use this and buy coke". The money will be wrapped in an envelope and presented to the CEO.

By 18:00hrs, the team had left for Owerri park, gotten a bus going to Aba and by 20:00hrs, the team arrived the city.
